        <p>
          I'm Sid. I was born in India and moved to Calgary AB,üçÅ in 2019. As a true lover of Science and Technology, I love building and deploying cool Web apps that accomplish business goals (like this App is deployed using AWS Amplify) and have a genuine passion for Physics. In my free time, I love to travel & explore.
